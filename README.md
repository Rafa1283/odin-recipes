# odin-recipes

<p>This read me file inside the recipes folder is just to let me know how far i have become in my road to learning how to code for my own.</p>

<p>I created a new repository inside my repos folder (idk if that is actually correct to say like that), and i am trying to learn how to commit my changes into Git.</p>
<p>The Odin project is actually a really cool platform to learn, at the beginning it was slow and a lot of theory and not so much coding, but now i am feeling that i can code at least rudimentary code.</p>
<p>Now i'm supposed to create a recipe webpage, let's see if i can manage :) i will be coming back at the end to do a self reflect on this. Today is saturday july 5 2025, i'm about to finish for the day because i have so much stuff to do, but i wanted to set up this project to feel that i have already started.</p>
